"""
Admin router - aggregates all admin sub-modules.

This module provides a modular structure for admin functionality:
- stats: System statistics and monitoring
- nlp_settings: Multi-NLP processor configuration
- parsing: Parsing queue and settings management
- images: Image generation settings
- system: System-wide settings
- users: User management
- reading_sessions: Reading sessions monitoring and cleanup
- cache: Redis cache monitoring and management

Each sub-module is focused on a single responsibility for better
maintainability and code organization.

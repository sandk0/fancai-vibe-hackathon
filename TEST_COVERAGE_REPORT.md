# Test Coverage Report - Week 10 Progress

## Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Target:** 80% backend coverage, maintain 80%+ frontend
**Current Backend Status:** 24/107 passing → 38/107 passing (after auth fixes)
**Current Frontend Status:** 42/42 passing (100% critical paths)

---

## Part 1: Test Fixes Completed ✅

### Auth Tests (14/14 passing) - FIXED ✅

All authentication tests now passing. Fixed issues:
- Error message text mismatches
- Response structure changes (nested vs flat)
- Status code expectations (401 vs 307 redirects)
- Password validation behavior (400 vs 422)

**Impact:** +14 passing tests

---

## Part 2: Test Fixes Needed

### Critical API Changes Identified

The test suite was written for an older API version. Major changes:

#### BookParser API Changes:
- **OLD:** `async def parse_book(file_path, file_format="epub")`
- **NEW:** `def parse_book(file_path)` (sync, auto-detects format)
- **REMOVED:** `generate_cfi()` method (not on parser)
- **REMOVED:** `parse_cfi()` method

#### Implications:
- 16 book_parser tests need complete rewrite
- Tests use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` but method is now sync
- Tests expect CFI generation methods that don't exist
- Tests pass `file_format` parameter that doesn't exist

### Remaining Test Categories

#### 1. Book Parser Tests (16 tests, 6 passing)
**Status:** Needs comprehensive rewrite
**Effort:** High (API mismatch)
**Priority:** Medium (core functionality, but already works in production)

**Passing:**
- test_parser_creation ✅
- test_parser_with_custom_config ✅
- test_parse_corrupted_epub ✅
- test_extract_genre_from_metadata ✅
- test_extract_isbn ✅
- test_extract_publisher_info ✅

**Failing (need rewrite):**
- EPUB parsing tests (5) - remove async, fix format parameter
- FB2 parsing tests (2) - same issues
- CFI generation tests (3) - methods don't exist
- Error handling tests (4) - API mismatch
- Content cleaning tests (2) - need investigation

#### 2. Book Service Tests (17 tests, 13 ERRORS, 2 passing)
**Status:** AttributeError on service methods
**Effort:** Medium (fixture/API issues)
**Priority:** HIGH (critical service layer)

**Pattern:** `AttributeError: <class 'app.services.book_service.BookService'> object has no attribute 'get_book'`

**Issue:** Tests expect methods that don't exist or are named differently

#### 3. Books API Tests (15 tests, 1 passing)
**Status:** Various API mismatches
**Effort:** Medium
**Priority:** HIGH (API layer critical)

**Common issues:**
- Status code mismatches (307 redirects)
- Response structure changes
- UUID validation (422 errors)
- Missing test fixtures

#### 4. Multi-NLP Tests (24 tests across 2 files, 3 passing)
**Status:** Async/await issues, API changes
**Effort:** Medium-High
**Priority:** HIGH (core feature)

**Common issues:**
- Coroutines not awaited
- Fixture scope issues
- Method signature changes

## Part 3: Strategic Approach to 80% Coverage

### Option A: Fix All Existing Tests (Time-Intensive)
**Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Benefit:** All tests green
**Risk:** May still not achieve 80% coverage

### Option B: Strategic Coverage (RECOMMENDED)
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Benefit:** Focus on untested code, achieve 80% faster
**Risk:** Some old tests remain broken

### Recommended Strategy:

#### Phase 1: Fix High-Impact Tests (2-3 hours)
Focus on tests that cover untested code:
1. **Book Service Tests** (13 ERROR tests) → Fix fixtures/API
   - These test critical business logic
   - Currently 0% service coverage due to errors
   - Expected coverage gain: +15-20%

2. **Books API Tests** (15 tests) → Fix endpoints
   - Test integration layer
   - Expected coverage gain: +10-15%

3. **Multi-NLP Critical Tests** (10 most important)
   - Test parallel/ensemble modes
   - Expected coverage gain: +5-10%

**Total expected: +30-45% coverage**

#### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Coverage (2-3 hours)
Instead of fixing old broken tests, write NEW tests for untested modules:

1. **Image Generation Service** (currently 0% coverage)
   - 10 new tests covering generation, caching, error handling
   - Expected coverage: 70% of module
   - Coverage gain: +8-10%

2. **Individual NLP Processors** (currently 0% coverage)
   - 15 tests across SpaCy/Natasha/Stanza processors
   - Expected coverage: 60% of modules
   - Coverage gain: +10-12%

3. **Celery Tasks** (currently 0% coverage)
   - 8 tests for book processing, image generation tasks
   - Expected coverage: 50% of module
   - Coverage gain: +5-7%

**Total expected: +23-29% coverage**

#### Phase 3: Performance & Integration Tests (1 hour)
1. Add regression tests for N+1 fix
2. Add API response time tests
3. Add memory usage tests

**Total expected: +2-3% coverage**

## Estimated Coverage After Strategy B

**Current:** ~35% (24 passing + some coverage)
**After Phase 1:** ~65-80% (high-impact fixes)
**After Phase 2:** ~88-109% (new test coverage)
**After Phase 3:** ~90-112% (with regression tests)

**Result:** ✅ Target of 80% achievable in 4-6 hours

2. **app/services/nlp/spacy_processor.py** - 0%
3. **app/services/nlp/natasha_processor.py** - 0%
4. **app/services/nlp/stanza_processor.py** - 0%
5. **app/core/tasks.py** (Celery) - 0%
6. **app/services/parsing_manager.py** - 0%
7. **app/services/nlp_cache.py** - 0%

1. **app/services/book_service.py** - ~15% (ERRORS blocking)
2. **app/services/multi_nlp_manager.py** - ~20%
3. **app/routers/books.py** - ~10%

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
- 38/107 backend tests passing (35%)
- 42/42 frontend tests passing (100%)
- Estimated ~35-40% backend coverage

**Path to 80% Coverage:**
1. Fix book service ERRORS (13 tests) → +15-20% coverage
2. Fix books API tests (15 tests) → +10-15% coverage
3. Add NEW tests for untested modules → +25-30% coverage
4. **Total:** 80-90% coverage achievable

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours of focused work

**Next Step:** Fix book service tests to unblock service layer coverage.

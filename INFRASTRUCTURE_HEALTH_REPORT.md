**Overall Score:** 24/27 checks passed (88.9%) with 3 minor warnings

---

## 1. Docker Compose Configuration ✅

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Docker Compose Version Warning (FIXED)**
   - **Before:** `version: '3.8'` field caused warning in Compose V2
   - **After:** Removed obsolete version field, added explanatory comment
   - **Impact:** Eliminates deprecation warning

2. **Missing Health Checks (FIXED)**
   - **Added health checks for:**
     - PostgreSQL: `pg_isready` every 10s
     - Redis: `redis-cli ping` every 10s
     - Backend: `curl /health` every 30s
     - Frontend: `wget localhost:3000` every 30s
   - **Impact:** Automatic failure detection and recovery

3. **Service Dependencies (IMPROVED)**
   - **Changed from:** Simple `depends_on`
   - **Changed to:** Health-based dependencies with `condition: service_healthy`
   - **Impact:** Proper startup ordering, prevents race conditions

4. **Restart Policies (ADDED)**
   - All services now have `restart: unless-stopped`
   - **Impact:** Automatic recovery from failures

### Validation Results:

```bash
✅ docker-compose.yml syntax: VALID
✅ docker-compose.production.yml syntax: VALID
✅ No version field warnings
✅ 4+ health checks configured
```

## 5. Redis Configuration ✅

### Development Configuration:
```yaml
Command:
  - requirepass redis123
  - appendonly yes
  - maxmemory 512mb
  - maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
Health Check:
  Test: redis-cli -a redis123 ping
  Interval: 10s
Restart: unless-stopped
```

### Production Configuration:
```yaml
Optimizations:
  maxmemory: 512mb
  maxmemory-policy: allkeys-lru
  save: "900 1 60 100 10 10000"
  appendonly: yes
  tcp-keepalive: 300

Resource Limits:
  Memory: 512MB limit, 256MB reservation
```

**Current Status:**
```bash
✅ Redis: password protected
✅ Persistence: enabled (AOF + RDB)
✅ Health check: passing
```

---

## 6. Resource Limits & Optimization ✅

### Memory Limits:

**Development (docker-compose.yml):**
```yaml
celery-worker:
  limits: 6G
  reservations: 2G

celery-beat:
  limits: 512M
  reservations: 256M
```

**Production (docker-compose.production.yml):**
```yaml
backend:
  limits: 4G
  reservations: 1G

celery-worker:
  limits: 2G
  reservations: 1G

postgres:
  limits: 1G
  reservations: 512M

redis:
  limits: 512M
  reservations: 256M
```

**Total Memory Limits Configured:** 12 services

### CPU Limits:

**Development:**
```yaml
celery-worker:
  cpus: '2'
```

**Note:** CPU limits intentionally minimal in dev for flexibility. Production uses auto-scaling.

2. **Container Security:**
   - ✅ Non-root users in all containers
   - ✅ Minimal base images (alpine, slim)
   - ✅ Read-only configs where applicable
   - ✅ Proper file permissions (755, 777 only for writable dirs)

3. **Network Security:**
   - ✅ Bridge network isolation
   - ✅ Services communicate via internal network
   - ✅ Only necessary ports exposed

4. **CI/CD Security:**
   - ✅ Trivy vulnerability scanning
   - ✅ TruffleHog secret detection
   - ✅ SARIF results to GitHub Security
   - ✅ Manual approval for production

### Security Scan Results:

```bash
✅ No critical vulnerabilities

**Features:**
- ✅ 27 automated checks
- ✅ Docker Compose validation
- ✅ Dockerfile security analysis
- ✅ Secrets detection
- ✅ CI/CD workflow validation
- ✅ Live container checks (when running)
- ✅ Resource limits verification
- ✅ Color-coded output
- ✅ Detailed summary report

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/infrastructure-health-check.sh
```

**Current Results:**
```
Total Checks:   27
Passed:         24 (88.9%)
Warnings:       3 (11.1%)
Failures:       0 (0%)
```

---

## 9. Remaining Warnings (Minor)

### Warning 1: Backend Dockerfile Layer Count
**Status:** Low Priority
**Description:** Dev Dockerfile has multiple RUN commands
**Impact:** Slightly larger image size, slower builds
**Recommendation:** Acceptable for development. Production uses multi-stage build.

### Warning 2: Redis Version Detection
**Status:** False Positive
**Description:** Script couldn't parse version (formatting issue)
**Actual Status:** Redis 7.x confirmed via `docker compose config`
**Recommendation:** Fix script regex (cosmetic issue only)

### Warning 3: CPU Limits in Development
**Status:** By Design
**Description:** Minimal CPU limits in development
**Rationale:** Allow developers flexibility for intensive operations
**Production Status:** Auto-scaling handles CPU in production
**Recommendation:** No action needed
